You can find this digital calculator project live at:

This code was made for the freeCodeCamp Front End Libraries - Build a JS Calculator exam.
If I got stuck, I followed the Youtube video-tutorial of Ian Robinson aka Useful Programmer. Ian uses Bootstrap, html, and pure js. I like his simple way of problem-solving.

I prefer the compact and professional way of code-structuring of WebDevSimplified. He uses a class constructor to code the calculator. If I grow up I'd be a similar pro:) But his solution is not following the fCC rules. It is a huge challenge to rework his code for the fCC project requirements.
